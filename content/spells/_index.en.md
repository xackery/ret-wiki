![Class Tree](images/progression.png)

Most content can be completed with a solid trio. While all trios can make it through most content, some are stronger than others. In general, picking a tank, a damage, and a healer will get you through most content. Some synergies, like Enchanter/Wizard, or Rogue/Necro are also very viable. The more advanced trios might be more of a chore to level and get geared/AA'd up, but they will out perform more generic combos in the long run.

Click on the classes below to see the available skills/AAs.
