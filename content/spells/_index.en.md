![GroupBuilder](content/images/Groupbuilder.png)


Most content can be completed with a solid trio. While all trios can make it through most content, some are stronger than others. In general, picking a tank, a damage, and a healer will get you through most content. Here are some other options.

- If you are going to 1box: Necro, Mage, Enchanter, Shaman, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, or Shadowknight are solid choices.
- If you are going to 2box: Any pet class + any healer | Any pet class + Pacifier, Puller, or CC (Cleric/Paladin/Bard/Enchanter/SK) | Any melee DPS class + healer
- If you are going to 3box: Any 2box suggestion + whatever you are missing (ie. something to take damage, something to heal the damage they take, and something to deal damage)
