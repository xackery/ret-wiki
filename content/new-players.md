**Welcome to Retribution!**

[![Main Site](https://retributioneq.com/)](/content/logo.png)
##  GETTING STARTED / FIRST STEPS

  * **WHAT IS RETRIBUTION?**

  * Retribution is an account based, personal progression PEQ server, and is not, nor claims to be affiliated with Daybreak Games.
  * Retribution allows players to relive forgotten memories of their Everquest conquests in nuanced ways through a unique mixture of rule-sets, quests, and items.

  * **WHAT IS THE RULESET?**

  * All players start in Classic EQ and can progress through Gates of Discord by killing raid bosses or collecting certain items from each expansion. Progression is account based, meaning YOU have to participate to unlock each expansion for yourself.

  * **WHAT ELSE MAKES RETRIBUTION UNIQUE?**

  * The Summoner's SynchroSatchel will work like your pet's inventory. Anything you put in there will be utilized by your pet (Armor/Weapons).  In can also be stored in the bank instead of on your character
  * Each player starts with pre-selected class defining AA, the ability to origin to the ORIGINAL bazaar, and access to new, powerful versions of their starting items.
  * Enemy strength, exp, and loot tables are all as you remember them… for the most part. As you relive memories of camping your favorite pieces of gear and slaying your favorite enemies, you will also begin to remember how strong you really were as you find rare   versions of all wearable items are available. Like our memories, all gear can be found as Rose Colored (1.5x Stats) or Apocryphal (2x Stats + Bonuses).
  * With the access to class defining AA and tens of thousands of new, incredibly strong, albeit familiar pieces of gear, players may be able to clear most content with a single group, and therefore will be limited to three boxing + 1 Bazaar mule.

  * **OTHER NOTABLE KEY FACTS ABOUT THE SERVER**

  * All wearable items have had their required and recommended levels removed.
  * All items are tradable, with the strongest Apocryphal versions being attunable.
  * AoC’s (instanced raid content) exist for every progression raid zone with a low 22hr lockout.
  * Classic versions of many zones have been restored.
  * Enemy and named spawn rate decreased to 10 minutes in almost all zones.
  * RoF Out of Combat Regen
  * OOC and AUC chat feed our Discord server, allowing for players to chat with their in game friends while offline.
  * Level caps match retail OTHER THAN classic being capped at 51 instead of 50 so you can grind AA while farming gear.
  * All AA through The Buried Sea are live and attainable beginning at level 51.
  * Big bags!


  * **WHAT IS THE RULESET?**

  * The "Bazaar Portal" when used will return you to the bazaar. Make sure to put this on your hotbar right away.  When you zone out of the bazaar, it will return you to wherever you were when you casted it. Some situations exist where this is not the case (Druid/Wizard Ports and Tearel). If you end up in the bazaar with no valid return destination, you will port to your bind point instead.

  * Once you have selected your characters, get out there and kill some monsters!


## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

To start Retribution:


  * You will first need an [EQ Emulator account](http://www.eqemulator.org/)

  * Once that is complete, [create a login server account](http://www.eqemulator.org/account/?CreateLS)

  * If you haven't already, [Download the Retribution patcher.zip from](https://retributioneq.com/retributioneq.zip) (you may need to click on the file and tell Windows it is safe by clicking the arrow on the download and selecting "Keep")

  * Right click the zipped download, go to properties, and check Unblock in the lower right. Then click OK.  Then extract the files to wherever you want EQ to be installed. Do not run the patcher in the same folder as another PEQ server install unless you are done playing on that server.

  * After extraction, find and run retributioneq.exe. This is the file you will run to patch and play.

  * Click "Patch" if it is Red (THIS MAY TAKE SOME TIME)

  * Click "Play" once the patch has finished or if patch is Grey (it will say Complete! Press Play to begin).
