description: A list of hunting locations for various level ranges
---

While some of these zones scale higher, we made this list based on the lowest level to enter. With gear, some of these might slide one way or another on the difficulty.

1+ Staying in your starting zone will yield the best experience for fresh characters with no gear. The ease of mobs and relative safety (near guards) should be an easy leveling experience.

10+ Some of these zones will carry you for quite awhile, while some will lose their xp potential quite quickly

Crushbone - Low difficulty near the entrance, but social aggro and the occasional running orcs might get you into a fun situation. Near the castle and in the castle pose more of a risk.

Upper Guk - UGuk will be quite popular for evil races in this level range. It is quite dense with mobs, and has alot of camps. Social aggro and runners could be an issue here.

Runnyeye  - The zone line is safe as well as the rest of the first floor. Going down floors while low level is not recommended. Snare is important.

Gorge of King Xorbb - Stay near the Runnyeye zoneline for safety and kill muddites and goblins.

North Ro - Dervish and Undead camps as well as a bunch of different roaming enemies. A good place to find your first jewelry.

Unrest - A very good option for the Faydwer races. Undead wont run when low, but they do social. With a good range of difficulty, staying here into your low 30s isnt unheard of.

15+ While some of the 10+ zones would fit into this list, thhere are some others that might be a nice change of pace.

East Karana - This is a potential death trap if you dont watch for roamers, but it could also be a tradesmans heaven. Lots of pelts will drop here.

South Ro - The crocodiles by the docks make a great starting point. Lockjaw will pose a risk, but also a decent reward.

Lavastorm - Will be high risk high reward. Lots of social aggro here, but good experience.

Lake Rathe - There are a few different camps all around the zone.

South Karana - The aviaks will be an easy target. They should be fairly easily pulled, and kited if needed.

Highpass Hold - While xp might not be as good as some of the other spots, the loot will help make this zone feel better.

20+

Permafrost - Lots of goblins to kill, and the potential to kill a progression target.

Cazic Thule - A loot dense zone, with a good variety of mobs to kill.

Mistmoore - While this zone will be quite difficult, it has very good mob density, as well as having very good loot for its level range.

25+

Splitpaw - A bit of a run, but a worthwhile venture.

Rathe Mountains Hill Giants - This is a great place if you would like to get some XP and make a lot of plat while you do it!

SolA - A good place to go if you have mapped out some of your epic pieces, as well as solid xp.

Kunark - Crypt of Dalnir - The mobs at the zone in are in the lower 30s and it gets progressively harder as you go.

Kunark - Frontier Mountains - Open zone, lots of room to kite if needed, not as densely populated as conventional indoor dungeons.

35+

Ocean of Tears Cyclops - This location is amazing for almost everyone! The cyclops can be single pulled, they don't hit very hard at all and they drop quite a bit of plat too!

Lower Guk - This zone will be able to cover a large level range. Good gear and undead mobs, makes this a popular zone.

SolB - Another higher level dungeon, that also leads to one of the classic progression targets.

The Hole - The highest scaling dungeon in the Classic era.

Kunark - Temple of Droga - It's filled with Kunark Goblins which have a tendancy to run when low on health as well as heal their allies through walls.

Kunark - City of Mist - This zone is great for this level range, with good loot as well.

Kunark -  Karnor's Castle - This zone is great for this level range, with good loot as well.

Kunark - Old Sebilis - This is some of the best XP you can get in the game for Kunark.

45+

Kunark - Chardok - This zone is huge and there is a ton of different nameds and loot for you to get. The deeper you go into the zone to the north or south, the harder it gets.

Kunark -  Howling Stones - There are no set named spawn locations in this zone. They can spawn randomly throughout all wings.
