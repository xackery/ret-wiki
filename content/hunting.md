10|9-10|Nektulos Forest|Ruins near East Commonlands|Zombies|100%|cla|Undead, easy to solo as a Necro at 8 (and maybe earlier, as Numb the Dead allows single pulls)
10-14|8+|Western Karana|#3, #6, and #16|Bandits|100%|cla|Save Bandit Sashes for Bandit Sashes (Quest); Clerics may need some twinking to solo these

12-18|?|Lesser Faydark|Nybright Sister Camp|Nybright Sisters|100%|cla|Kill Kayla Nybright first to break camp (Harmony or similar agro reducers helps)

13-15|?|Western Karana|Small settlement in Northwest corner of zone|Guard Gregor and Misty Storyswapper|100%|cla|At level 13 Guard Gregor is blue and Misty Storyswapper can be white or yellow, but either version should  be soloable.  Both are on a six minute timer.  Watch out for Guard McCluskey, as he rarely paths by and will assist (but if you give him a couple minutes he'll eventually path away). Anyone (even Iksar) can sell to Silna Weaver, behind building. Lowers factions: Antonius Bayle, Guards of Qeynos, Merchants of Qeynos, Knights of Truth, and League of Antonican Bards
14-16|14-16|Kerra Island|Entrance|a kerran awrat and a kerran mamluk|120%|cla|Kerrans tend to come in pairs, which is great for charming; if you're not charming you will want Harmony, Soothe or a similar spell; avoid the huts to the left/right of the entrance: they contain merchants (who don't give XP), and aggroing anything near the hut will aggro them too; hurts Kerra Isle faction; Kerrans conveniently drop food/drink
14-19|14-19|East Karana|Gnolls in the southwest|a gnoll reaver and an undead reaver|100%|cla|Great solo camp; fast respawn and plenty of mobs almost all standing alone.

15-20|15-20|Kithicor Forest|Camp high up on the West wall, South end, and pull Shraloks from that corner|Shralok Orcs|100%|cla|A passable alternative to Misty Thicket during the day.

15|15|Kurn's Tower|Main floor|Assorted|200%|kunark|
15-18|?|South Karana|The plains area (ie. most of the zone)|an adult elephant, an elephant, an elephant calf|100%|cla|
15-20|15-20|Befallen|Second and Third Floor|Skeletons, Mummies, Ghouls, Necromancers|213%|cla|Good for melee (who can take a beating from multiple enemies) and classes who can control undead. High chance of adds, but high ZEM. Be careful of Necromancers, who can be a little more difficult (adds a pet and DoTs).
15-20|15-20|Kithicor Forest|Near the entrance to Rivervale|Beetles, Snakes, Bixies, Bears, Wolves|133%|cla|A passable alternative to Misty Thicket during the day. Do not be here at night as high level Undead spawn. Also of note is that there are no guards at the entrance to Rivervale.
15|15|Kurn's Tower|Main floor|Assorted|200%|kunark|
15-18|-|South Karana|The plains area (ie. most of the zone)|an adult elephant, an elephant, an elephant calf|100%|cla|
15-20|15-20|Befallen|Second and Third Floor|Skeletons, Mummies, Ghouls, Necromancers|213%|cla|Good for melee (who can take a beating from multiple enemies) and classes who can control undead. High chance of adds, but high ZEM. Be careful of Necromancers, who can be a little more difficult (adds a pet and DoTs).
15-20|15-20|Highpass Hold|?|Orcs and Gnolls|107%|cla|
15-20|15-20|Permafrost|Near zone-in|Ice Goblins|120%|cla|Mobs start turning green at 18, but XP is still really good even then.  Mobs are usually in pairs, so you may want to bring both to the zone line, kill one, zone, then come back (if you don't have CC).
15-21|15-21|Oasis of Marr|Various, including #2|Caimans and Crocodiles|100%|cla|Avoid higher level Deepwater Crodcodiles
16-21|15-20|Gorge of King Xorbb|Near the Runnyeye zone line|Muddites, Minotaurs, Beholders|100%|cla|Zone line lets you easily zone out (but has goblins). Avoid central areas with significantly higher level beholders. Muddites and minotaurs tend to be easier, while beholders are a lot harder (they have an enchanter pet and can nuke hard if you can't interrupt). Use the walls to navigate the zone without picking up lots of agro.
16-21|Gorge of King Xorbb|Near the East Karana zone line|a Chasm Minotaur, a Gorge Minotaur, a Muddite Minor, a Muddite Elder|100%|cla|Pull from the three canyons, starting with the East, then North, then West.  Avoid the beholders (they're much more powerful), which tend to come from East tunnel.  One minotaur can spawn in the space between the canyons, so pull to the hill slightly farther back to avoid having him spawn on you.  If you avoid killing Goblins you could eventually get enough faction with them to be able to use their bank in Runnyeye (but it will take lots of killing here)
16-17|-|Erud's Crossing|Whole island|Kerrans|?|cla|Lowers Kerra Isle faction
16-19|15-19|Lavastorm Mountains|Near zone-in from Nektulos Forest or Najena|a fire elemental, a lava crawler, a lava basilisk, a Rock Dervish, etc.|100%|cla|Pull to zone-in area to avoid adds; With the exception of a fire elemental and a fire imp most mobs are not threatening to attack.
16-18|-|Toxxulia Forest|On the way to Paineel|Pixies|100%|cla|Pixies are non-social
16-20|14-18|The Overthere|Mudhole (Semi Dry Lake)|Cockatrices, Succulents, Sabre-toothed Tigers, etc.|100%|kunark|From boat keep water on your left until you get to the hills, then go right to the Mudhole.  Watch for Sarnaks, as they are social and will agro.
16-20|14-18|Upper Guk|Near the zone-in|?|166%|cla|
16-40|-|Paineel|Multiple locations|Guards|100%|paineel|Has no faction hit, each mob drops 10pp in loot per kill. Heavily camped, some guards have up to 24min respawn timers.
17-21|-|Western Plains of Karana|Field at #10 |Scarecrows|100%|cla|Scarecrows  don't run and are undead, so you can use Sense the Dead to find the closest one.  They don't agro, can very rarely proc "fear" (stun), and they sometimes drop Sack of Hay for the nearby Gathering Grain quest (which gives an extra 1% XP or less).  Watch out for werewolves and (during the era when they appear) swarmlings and The Swarm Mother, as they path through the field periodically .
17-21|-|Dagnor's Cauldron|NE corner|Sandbar Serpents|100%|cla|In the NE corner of the zone, three serpents on 2:00 timers spawn as placeholders for Jetsam, Flotsam, and Squallslither within sight of each other. This may be the fastest spawning camp in the game — these mobs will respawn as fast as you can kill them for theoretically zero downtime. Occasionally, Barnacle Bones or a PH will wander through.
18-22|17-22|Rathe Mountains|#3|a kodiak bear|100%|cla|Avoid the Unkempt Preservers when pulling (they will attack you if you attack the bears); if you have a spell like Harmony you can also kill Blinde the Cutpurse in nearby area #6
18-25|17-24|Lake Rathetear|Aviak islands|Aviak guards|100%|cla|Aviaks are faction-less, but social. There are seven aviak guards total in the west part of the zone (near the Arena). Levitate speeds things up a ton by being able to scoot across water
19|12-19|Oasis of Marr|Orc Highway|Orcs|100%|cla|
19-21|17-19|Kerra Island|?|Kerrans|120%|cla|
19-23|-|East Karana|Throughout zone|a war wolf, a lion patriarch, a rogue lion, a spirit stalker, a dark stalker, a gorge hound, a griffon
19-23|17-21|East Karana|Gnolls in the southwest|a gnoll reaver and an undead reaver|100%|cla|Great solo camp; fast respawn and plenty of mobs almost all standing alone.
19-24|-|The Overthere|Mudhole (Semi Dry Lake)|Cockatrices, Succulents, Sabre-toothed Tigers, etc.|100%|kunark|From boat keep water on your left until you get to the hills, then go right to the Mudhole.  Watch for Sarnaks, as they are social and will agro.
20|20|Upper Guk|Squire Camp|A Froglok Gaz Squire and other frogloks|166%|cla|
20-23|20-23|Oasis|?|a deepwater crocodile, a deepwater caiman|100%|cla|For DRU
20-24|20-24|Stonebrunt Mountains|Kejekan Mines, #2|a kejekan miner x4|100%|warrens|Extremely safe camp. The Kejek in the village do not see invis, and are indifferent
20-24|20-24|West Freeport|-107, -430|Trissa Whistlesong|100%|cla|Lazy single kill every 6m40s
20-24|20-24|Kurn's Tower|Start at top, work down to the lower tunnels|Greater Scalebones, Lesser Icebones, Lesser Charbones|200%|kunark|Skeletons are not social
20-24|17-22|Timorous Deep|Elven Outpost Docks|An elven ranger, an elven scout, an elven war scout|100%|kunark|Lowers Inhabitants of Firiona Vie and Greater Faydark factions
22-27|22-27|Lake Rathetear|location 2, near South Karana zone line|a greater zombie, an exhumed gnoll|100%|cla|All undead, but only at night: during the day there's only lower-level gnolls (see below for undead in nearby Rathe Mountains); because the mobs are close Soothe/Harmony helps, but characters at the higher-end of the level range can pull singles without it
