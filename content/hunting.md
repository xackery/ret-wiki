1-10|5-10|Kithicor Forest|Near the entrance to Rivervale|Beetles, Snakes, Bixies, Bears, Wolves|133%|cla|A passable alternative to Misty Thicket during the day. Do not be here at night as high level Undead spawn. Also of note is that there are no guards at the entrance to Rivervale.
3-5|1-4|Steamfont Mountains|Crater near the Druid Ring, Kobold Camp just north of the crater|Spiderlings, a small coyote, a kobold scout|133%|cla|Excellent for solo players near Felwithe to bridge the gap between Level 3 and 5

4-6|3-5|Greater Faydark|"Orc hill" (north end of zone before Crushbone)|Orcs|133%|cla|Orcs are clumped so soloing is more difficult here; Save Crushbone Belts for Crushbone Belts (Quest)

Necros can solo here 5-8 but half the bears will turn green at 8.  Lots of spiders in area too for crafters.  If you stay on road friendly shammies will sometimes SOW you.
5-8|4-7|Nektulos Forest|Undead Pillar/Wizard Spires|a skeleton,  a decaying skeleton,  a zombie and a lesser mummy|100%|cla|Easy to solo as a necro, Numb the Dead will let you single pull everything to break.  The wizard spires have more wanderers so is a little more dangerous.  Undead Pillar is close to zone.  Occasional red a lesser mummy may need to be trained to guards at bridge, easier at pillar than spires.
5-10|5-10|East Commonlands|?|Orcs, Dervish Cutthroats|100%|cla|Save Deathfist Slashed Belts for Deathfist Slashed Belts (Quest); players sitting in the tunnel (auctioning) will often give free buffs

6-11|6-11|Befallen|Entrance|Assorted|213%|cla|Be careful of the named mob Gynok Moltor, his PH is the monster that spawns at the front and path around the dungeon

6-7|4-7|Steamfont|Kobold camps|Kobolds|100%|cla|
7-11|6-10|Steamfont|South of minotaur cave, along the wall, eg. 750, -1990|earth elementals, drakes, skeletons, harpies, etc.|100%|cla|Watch out for Nilit's Contraption, and the Minotaur Hero (if you go past the caves); also the earth elementals and harpies tend to be a little tougher
7-10|7-10|Crushbone|Entry area, slave area, trainer hill|Orcs|213%|cla|Save Crushbone Belts for Crushbone Belts (Quest)
8-12|8-12|Clan Runnyeye|First floor|Goblins|133%|cla|West-most camp has only 2 goblins, easy to break even if soloing
8-12|8-12|Blackburrow|Past first door but not past other doors|Gnolls|133%|cla|Save Gnoll Fangs for Gnoll Bounty or Moonstones; trains are common
8-16|8-16|Everfrost|Plains/Tundra|a polar bear, snow orc trooper, a giant wooly spider|100%|cla|South wall of zone makes a good pull spot
9-14|9-14|Rathe Mountains|Beetle altars (Zaza and Ankh)|Ankhesenaten, Ankhetperure, Ankhnesmerira, Zazamaharet, Zazamenhu, Zazaphenebti|100%|cla|Three named beetles at each altar, far enough apart for easy solo pulling. They move slower than normal run speed so can be easily kited.
9-18|9-18|Kurn's Tower|?|Assorted|200%|kunark|Skeletons are not social
10|9-10|Nektulos Forest|Ruins near East Commonlands|Zombies|100%|cla|Undead, easy to solo as a Necro at 8 (and maybe earlier, as Numb the Dead allows single pulls)
10-14|8+|Western Karana|#3, #6, and #16|Bandits|100%|cla|Save Bandit Sashes for Bandit Sashes (Quest); Clerics may need some twinking to solo these
10-15|10-15|Upper Guk|Near Heartspiders (map location 18) and Near steps to scryer|a swampwater crocodile|159%|cla|Four spawns of swampwater crocodiles near the heartspiders by map location 18, non-aggro and non-social. One spawns in a small cubby, one wanders in the water, and two more spawn in the water near the stairs down to froglok scryer at map location 15. One of the spawns in that latter room is consistently higher level than the others.
12-17|10-16|Lake Rathetear|Bandit Camp (map location 7)|A band
10-15|10-15|Estate of Unrest|Entrance area (outside house)|Assorted ("yard trash")|173%|cla|

10-12|8-11|Qeynos Catacombs|Thug Camp, area 17 then area 15 A_thug, then A smuggler|?|cla|
11-13|9-13|Butcherblock Mountains|Chess board (#7)|an undead bishop, an undead pawn, etc.|100%|cla|All undead, watch out for an undead king  (he is much higher level).  Rogues may require twinking
11-15|10-15|Butcherblock Mountains|Goblin camps (#5, #6, #15, #22)|Goblins|100%|cla|Will need ability to split goblins if soloing, watch out for Goblin Shaman/Wizards
11-15|10-15|Butcherblock Mountains|Bandit camp (#12)|Dwarf bandits|100%|cla|All bandits can be solo pulled easily, some have short patrols
11-15|11-15|Northern Desert of Ro|?|Scarabs|100%|cla|If you ask nicely sellers in East Commonlands may buff you
8-15|8-15|Befallen|Past the First locked door|Assorted|213%|cla|Need to have the Splintered Wooden Key from the a shadowknight
11-15|?|Erud's Crossing|slightly off the west coast|A Zombie Sailor|?|cla|
11-15|?|Timorous Deep|?|Streamer fish|100%|kunark|Can't bind in zone
12-16|?|Steamfont|North of Lesser Faydark zoneline|4x a Minotaur Slaver|?|cla|4 static spawns that can be single pulled, close to zone line, you can also grab the occasional nearby a harpy or a giant rat
12-16|?|West Commonlands|?|a willowisp and a Dervish Cutthroat (and others)|?|cla|Charm a willowisp and use it to kill Dervish Cutthroats (they won't be able to hurt it because it's immune to non-magic weapons)
12-16|?|Erud's Crossing|Whole island|Will o' Wisps|?|cla|Wisps drop Lightstones  and Greater Lightstones which can be sold (for ≈1p/≈4.5p) or turned in for the quests Research Aid/Evil Research; if you kill anything except wisps you can easily agro the entire island
12-16|?|The Overthere|Southeast of outpost/North of chasm|Cockatrices, Succulents, a sabertooth cat, a sabertooth tigress, etc.|100%|kunark|Lots of animals, which would normally be good for Druids, except that they have abnormally high resist rates
12-16|?|Ocean of Tears|Sisters Island (#10)|Sister of Erollisi|?|cla|Vendor on same island; lowers Clerics of Tunare/Faydarks Champions/King Tearis Thex/Soldiers of Tunare faction
12-18|?|Lesser Faydark|Nybright Sister Camp|Nybright Sisters|100%|cla|Kill Kayla Nybright first to break camp (Harmony or similar agro reducers helps)
13-15|?|Western Plains of Karana|West Karana|Bandits|100%|cla|Bandit Sashes can be turned in for experience
13-15|?|Western Karana|Small settlement in Northwest corner of zone|Guard Gregor and Misty Storyswapper|100%|cla|At level 13 Guard Gregor is blue and Misty Storyswapper can be white or yellow, but either version should  be soloable.  Both are on a six minute timer.  Watch out for Guard McCluskey, as he rarely paths by and will assist (but if you give him a couple minutes he'll eventually path away). Anyone (even Iksar) can sell to Silna Weaver, behind building. Lowers factions: Antonius Bayle, Guards of Qeynos, Merchants of Qeynos, Knights of Truth, and League of Antonican Bards
14-16|14-16|Kerra Island|Entrance|a kerran awrat and a kerran mamluk|120%|cla|Kerrans tend to come in pairs, which is great for charming; if you're not charming you will want Harmony, Soothe or a similar spell; avoid the huts to the left/right of the entrance: they contain merchants (who don't give XP), and aggroing anything near the hut will aggro them too; hurts Kerra Isle faction; Kerrans conveniently drop food/drink
14-19|14-19|East Karana|Gnolls in the southwest|a gnoll reaver and an undead reaver|100%|cla|Great solo camp; fast respawn and plenty of mobs almost all standing alone.
14-19|14-19|Everfrost|Plains/Tundra|a mammoth calf|100%|cla|
14-19|14-19|Lake of Ill Omen|?|a sabertooth cat and a sabertooth tigress|87%|kunark|
14-19|14-19|Northern Karana|?|a highland lion and a griffawn|100%|cla|
15-20|15-20|Kithicor Forest|Camp high up on the West wall, South end, and pull Shraloks from that corner|Shralok Orcs|100%|cla|A passable alternative to Misty Thicket during the day. Do not be here at night as high level Undead spawn. Also of note is that there are no guards at the entrance to Rivervale.
15|15|Kurn's Tower|Main floor|Assorted|200%|kunark|
15-18|?|South Karana|The plains area (ie. most of the zone)|an adult elephant, an elephant, an elephant calf|100%|cla|
15-20|15-20|Befallen|Second and Third Floor|Skeletons, Mummies, Ghouls, Necromancers|213%|cla|Good for melee (who can take a beating from multiple enemies) and classes who can control undead. High chance of adds, but high ZEM. Be careful of Necromancers, who can be a little more difficult (adds a pet and DoTs).
15-20|15-20|Kithicor Forest|Near the entrance to Rivervale|Beetles, Snakes, Bixies, Bears, Wolves|133%|cla|A passable alternative to Misty Thicket during the day. Do not be here at night as high level Undead spawn. Also of note is that there are no guards at the entrance to Rivervale.
15|15|Kurn's Tower|Main floor|Assorted|200%|kunark|
15-18|-|South Karana|The plains area (ie. most of the zone)|an adult elephant, an elephant, an elephant calf|100%|cla|
15-20|15-20|Befallen|Second and Third Floor|Skeletons, Mummies, Ghouls, Necromancers|213%|cla|Good for melee (who can take a beating from multiple enemies) and classes who can control undead. High chance of adds, but high ZEM. Be careful of Necromancers, who can be a little more difficult (adds a pet and DoTs).
15-20|15-20|Highpass Hold|?|Orcs and Gnolls|107%|cla|
15-20|15-20|Permafrost|Near zone-in|Ice Goblins|120%|cla|Mobs start turning green at 18, but XP is still really good even then.  Mobs are usually in pairs, so you may want to bring both to the zone line, kill one, zone, then come back (if you don't have CC).
15-21|15-21|Oasis of Marr|Various, including #2|Caimans and Crocodiles|100%|cla|Avoid higher level Deepwater Crodcodiles
16-21|15-20|Gorge of King Xorbb|Near the Runnyeye zone line|Muddites, Minotaurs, Beholders|100%|cla|Zone line lets you easily zone out (but has goblins). Avoid central areas with significantly higher level beholders. Muddites and minotaurs tend to be easier, while beholders are a lot harder (they have an enchanter pet and can nuke hard if you can't interrupt). Use the walls to navigate the zone without picking up lots of agro.
16-21|Gorge of King Xorbb|Near the East Karana zone line|a Chasm Minotaur, a Gorge Minotaur, a Muddite Minor, a Muddite Elder|100%|cla|Pull from the three canyons, starting with the East, then North, then West.  Avoid the beholders (they're much more powerful), which tend to come from East tunnel.  One minotaur can spawn in the space between the canyons, so pull to the hill slightly farther back to avoid having him spawn on you.  If you avoid killing Goblins you could eventually get enough faction with them to be able to use their bank in Runnyeye (but it will take lots of killing here)
16-17|-|Erud's Crossing|Whole island|Kerrans|?|cla|Lowers Kerra Isle faction
16-19|15-19|Lavastorm Mountains|Near zone-in from Nektulos Forest or Najena|a fire elemental, a lava crawler, a lava basilisk, a Rock Dervish, etc.|100%|cla|Pull to zone-in area to avoid adds; With the exception of a fire elemental and a fire imp most mobs are not threatening to attack.
16-18|-|Toxxulia Forest|On the way to Paineel|Pixies|100%|cla|Pixies are non-social
16-20|14-18|The Overthere|Mudhole (Semi Dry Lake)|Cockatrices, Succulents, Sabre-toothed Tigers, etc.|100%|kunark|From boat keep water on your left until you get to the hills, then go right to the Mudhole.  Watch for Sarnaks, as they are social and will agro.
16-20|14-18|Upper Guk|Near the zone-in|?|166%|cla|
16-40|-|Paineel|Multiple locations|Guards|100%|paineel|Has no faction hit, each mob drops 10pp in loot per kill. Heavily camped, some guards have up to 24min respawn timers.
17-21|-|Western Plains of Karana|Field at #10 |Scarecrows|100%|cla|Scarecrows  don't run and are undead, so you can use Sense the Dead to find the closest one.  They don't agro, can very rarely proc "fear" (stun), and they sometimes drop Sack of Hay for the nearby Gathering Grain quest (which gives an extra 1% XP or less).  Watch out for werewolves and (during the era when they appear) swarmlings and The Swarm Mother, as they path through the field periodically .
17-21|-|Dagnor's Cauldron|NE corner|Sandbar Serpents|100%|cla|In the NE corner of the zone, three serpents on 2:00 timers spawn as placeholders for Jetsam, Flotsam, and Squallslither within sight of each other. This may be the fastest spawning camp in the game — these mobs will respawn as fast as you can kill them for theoretically zero downtime. Occasionally, Barnacle Bones or a PH will wander through.
18-22|17-22|Rathe Mountains|#3|a kodiak bear|100%|cla|Avoid the Unkempt Preservers when pulling (they will attack you if you attack the bears); if you have a spell like Harmony you can also kill Blinde the Cutpurse in nearby area #6
18-25|17-24|Lake Rathetear|Aviak islands|Aviak guards|100%|cla|Aviaks are faction-less, but social. There are seven aviak guards total in the west part of the zone (near the Arena). Levitate speeds things up a ton by being able to scoot across water
19|12-19|Oasis of Marr|Orc Highway|Orcs|100%|cla|
19-21|17-19|Kerra Island|?|Kerrans|120%|cla|
19-23|-|East Karana|Throughout zone|a war wolf, a lion patriarch, a rogue lion, a spirit stalker, a dark stalker, a gorge hound, a griffon
19-23|17-21|East Karana|Gnolls in the southwest|a gnoll reaver and an undead reaver|100%|cla|Great solo camp; fast respawn and plenty of mobs almost all standing alone.
19-24|-|The Overthere|Mudhole (Semi Dry Lake)|Cockatrices, Succulents, Sabre-toothed Tigers, etc.|100%|kunark|From boat keep water on your left until you get to the hills, then go right to the Mudhole.  Watch for Sarnaks, as they are social and will agro.
20|20|Upper Guk|Squire Camp|A Froglok Gaz Squire and other frogloks|166%|cla|
20-23|20-23|Oasis|?|a deepwater crocodile, a deepwater caiman|100%|cla|For DRU
20-24|20-24|Stonebrunt Mountains|Kejekan Mines, #2|a kejekan miner x4|100%|warrens|Extremely safe camp. The Kejek in the village do not see invis, and are indifferent
20-24|20-24|West Freeport|-107, -430|Trissa Whistlesong|100%|cla|Lazy single kill every 6m40s
20-24|20-24|Kurn's Tower|Start at top, work down to the lower tunnels|Greater Scalebones, Lesser Icebones, Lesser Charbones|200%|kunark|Skeletons are not social
20-24|17-22|Timorous Deep|Elven Outpost Docks|An elven ranger, an elven scout, an elven war scout|100%|kunark|Lowers Inhabitants of Firiona Vie and Greater Faydark factions
22-27|22-27|Lake Rathetear|location 2, near South Karana zone line|a greater zombie, an exhumed gnoll|100%|cla|All undead, but only at night: during the day there's only lower-level gnolls (see below for undead in nearby Rathe Mountains); because the mobs are close Soothe/Harmony helps, but characters at the higher-end of the level range can pull singles without it

  |area={{Loc|Najena|80, -58}}
  |monsters=  [[A_Skeleton_(Najena) | a skeleton]]
  |xpModifier=159%
  |for=PAL, CLR
  |notes= Individual spawns of [[A_Skeleton_(Najena) | a skeleton]] that are quite safe, free from adds, and frequently drop [[Small_Ringmail_Gloves | small ringmail gloves]] and [[Small_Ringmail_Bracelet | small ringmail bracelet]] for vendoring. Skeletons drop a piece for [[Paladin]] quest [[The Sword of Nobility]]. Several spawns exist, but the most accessible is marked.

{{HuntingGuideSpot
  |soloLevel= 22-30
  |groupLevel= 20-30
  |zone=Misty Thicket
  |area= west of the Great Wall, just east of the orc camp along the north zone wall.
  |monsters= [[Slaythe]]
  |xpModifier= 100%
  |for=DRU
  |image=[[File:Npc slaythe.png|100px|center]]
  |notes= [[Slaythe]] is spawned by asking [[Bronin Higginsbot]], on top of the southernmost Wall Tower in [[Misty Thicket]], for a 'small favor'.  After that run north along the west side of the Great Wall until you reach the north zone wall, where Slaythe is waiting. Kill the frog and and turn his leg into [[Bronin Higginsbot]] for [[The Bloody Shank|The Bloody Shank (quest)]], then you can respawn [[Slaythe]].

Requires indifferent faction with the [[Rivervale]] [[Rogue]] faction, [[DeepPockets]] (wolf form works); Bronin will not spawn [[Slaythe]] at lower faction. Killing Slaythe lowers [[Frogloks of Kunark]], while turning his leg in raises [[Highpass Guards]], [[Carson McCabe]], [[Merchants of Highpass]], [[Corrupt Qeynos Guards]], [[Freeport Militia]]

VERY good, safe and steady EXP.  Druids (with  wolf form and levitate, to jump off the stumps west of the wall to get to the top of the tower and respawn) can do this especially quickly.  Just nuke/kite (unsnared) down the wall, avoiding the guards, and finish him off near the tower for a quick respawn.

  |monsters= [[A Magician]]
  |xpModifier= 173%
  |for=MAG
  |image=[[File:Npc_a_magician.png|60px|center]]
  |notes= This room has 3 [[A Magician|magicians]] which you can split just by using line of sight. Edge down the left side of the hall until you can "see" the right mob and pull. Repeat on the right side.  These magicians drop [[Magician Focus Items|Mage focus item components]]: [[A Broom]], [[A Shovel]], [[A Stein]], & [[A Torch]] (although not initially in {{Era|Classic}}).<br/>

At 26 I was getting 6% of level for 1 Mage and pet.  Respawn is 18:30. In that time you can also kill the 2 [[Skeleton]]s just in the cave before the crystal room and two possible [[A tentacle terror (Najena)|tentacle terrors]] in the entrance room (or some spiders not too far from the skeletons).<br/>

Alternatively in {{Era|Classic}} you can wait on the <code>/list</code> for [[Drelzna]], as this room is within the <code>/list</code> range.

Ulrich becomes a blue con (and becomes soloable by non-Necros) at 31.  [[Guard Donlan]] also paths through village and you can kill him (but he lowers Corrupt Qeynos Guard faction).

Many scholars charm you (and bring you back to their spawn point, which is often a death sentence); Clerics should intersperse every nuke with a stun to avoid this.   Have a CR plan, because even if you are bound outside, you or your rezzer will need a way to get the level #2 key (eg. make a corpse on level #1 with a backup key, or camp an alt nearby who can farm the key). }}

[[a kromrif prison guard]] make for excellent charmed pets. The surrounding orcs won't social with them, so simply lulling one and pulling the other away a bit > rooting it will work for setting up a charm. Another hitch is Warden Bruke has a chance of spawning instead of A Kromrif Prison Guard. Warden Bruke is higher level, has high MR, and will spawn three guards upon engagement.

  |notes= If giant fort is taken you can pull from the "field" just south of this hunting spot.  The field has various mobs (largely sarnaks) pathing through it, so sometimes its barren and other times its busy. If you bring your pull back towards the valley on the way to Skyfire you can avoid adds (and run to zone if needed).

  |notes=Decent (but not great) loot of non-Velious gems.  The easy/4-goo cave spaces the goos apart, so no [[Harmony]] is needed, but the southern cave has goos next to each other, so you'll need it (or another way to deal with 2+ at once).  Because the goos are KOS to the adjacent geonids, if you haven't ruined your faction you can run to them for help.

  |notes=Being Velious, these giants have more HP than (say) Forest Giants in Burning Woods (Kunark), and so are slower XP.  However, they do still give some XP, and also give both [[Claws of Veeshan]] and [[Coldain]] faction.<br/><br/>

Start along west wall (either by the boulder south of fort, or even further south).  Park pet (if any), then run East to find Frost Giant Elites.  Bring them back to wall to avoid adds.  At 59 some elites turn light blue, but many remain blue.

Chance of both squires and knights; you will get lost at some point; closest entrance is between McStinkles and McSprayel, by the door they 'guard'. McStinkles does not summon, McSprayel does. Should not go before level 52 due to agro issues getting cothed to the PoM cubby. Learn the pathing mobs in your fight area before you start pulling.

  |era=Velious
  |for=ROG
  |notes=This is not a place to camp, so much as something to keep in mind and take advantage of when in the area.  The [[Shardwing Courier]]'s quest turnin is worth approximately 1.5% of level 59 for a Human Rogue, and can be turned in with hide+sneak or good Kromzek/Tormax faction.  It also gives an item that may sell for a few hundred plat.  If you are in [[Western Wastes]] anyway (perhaps for scout roll or going to/from ToV), he is well worth killing if he is up and you can do the turn-in. He is class/gear dependent (a 59 Rogue was able to solo it with poison and minor raid gear).

  |for=
  |notes= In the upper 50's the castle will start to green out, but it is still good xp. Stronger groups can move down to old Erudin. The docks is the most popular camp to pull the town, but the town entrance is also a good place to set up. Extremely strong groups can move down to the undead tower but please note that crowd control is difficult requiring an enchanter to often rely on dictate. Ghosts will flee at low health.

  |area= Yael Pit
  |monsters= Elementals, Rat, Rock Golems
  |xpModifier= 200%
  |era=Hole
  |for=SHM/DRU/NEC
  |notes= Good for root rot on the Elementals and Rat spawns. Elementals sometimes spawn as Harvester (Cleric) which won't heal if nothing is in melee range or Wizards; both of these have nasty nukes, so buff up your resists or park them somewhere that you can line of sight their casting. Rock Golems can summon depending on level, only fight them if you can melee and survive (SHM with slow). 4 mobs in pit, more mobs up the ramp through the rock door. Watch out for [[Nortlav the Scalekeeper]] who is not KOS, but will social aggro Hole mobs. Watch out for [[Master Yael]] spawn timer so he doesn't kill you while grinding.

Avoid [[Esorpa of the Ring]] who is on [[Ring of Scale]] faction, and beware of [[An ice burrower]]. Worms are '''extremely''' magic resistant and require epic click with glamour to successfully ensnare (even then it may take many casts).
