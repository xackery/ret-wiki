    <h2>What is Retribution?</h2>
    <p>Retribution is an account based, personal progression PEQ server, not affiliated with Daybreak Games. It allows players to relive forgotten memories of their Everquest conquests in nuanced ways through a unique mixture of rule-sets, quests, and items.</p>

    <h2>What is the Ruleset?</h2>
    <p>All players start in Classic EQ and can progress through Gates of Discord by killing raid bosses or collecting certain items from each expansion. Progression is account based, meaning <span class="highlight">YOU</span> have to participate to unlock each expansion for yourself.</p>

    <h2>What Else Makes Retribution Unique?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Summoner's SynchroSatchel acts as your pet's inventory, storing anything from Armor to Weapons, which your pet can utilize. It can also be stored in the bank instead of on your character.</li>
        <li>Each player starts with pre-selected class defining AA, the ability to origin to the ORIGINAL bazaar, and access to new, powerful versions of their starting items.</li>
        <li>Enemy strength, exp, and loot tables are all as you remember themâ€¦ for the most part. As you relive memories of camping your favorite pieces of gear and slaying your favorite enemies, you will also begin to remember how strong you really were as you find rare versions of all wearable items. Gear can be found as Rose Colored (1.5x Stats) or Apocryphal (2x Stats + Bonuses).</li>
        <li>With access to tens of thousands of new, incredibly strong, albeit familiar pieces of gear, players may clear most content with a single group. Players are limited to three boxing + 1 Bazaar mule.</li>
    </ul>
